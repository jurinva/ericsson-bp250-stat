# ericsson-bp250-stat
This is a very old (since 2005) Perl script to get statistics from the Ericsson BusinessPhone 250 console port.
It was based on some other script from the Internet (I can't find the original now).

This script puts all the data into a mysql database.
Unfortunately, I don't have SQL files to create tables.
But I think if it is useful, you will be able to create tables yourself
